  If the value is ```serial```, the document **must** contain an ```interface``` key which **must** contain the name of the serial serial interface attached to the aREST target. A ```serial``` document **may** also contain ```speed``` and ```serialFormat``` keys. 

  * The ```speed``` key, if present, **must** be interpreted as a serial speed in bps. If this key is not present, this module **must** default to 115200 (bps).

  * The ```serialFormat``` key, if present, **must** be interepreted as the same format as 8N1 (eight data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit). This **shall** default to 8N1 if not present. Only 8N1 must be supported.
