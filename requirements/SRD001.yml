  MOOS aREST interface module

  This module provides a mechanism for a MOOS community to use an Arduino-compatible board running an aREST sketch as a physical interface device. It provides interface routines for all of the major aREST calls. 

  This library uses libcurl as the communication mechanism. 

  Implementation of a serial interface is planned for the future but has not been implemented for this iteration.
