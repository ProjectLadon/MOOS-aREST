  If ```variablePollPeriod``` is set and variables are returned that are not named by corresponding ```variable``` declarations, those variables **shall** be published under names formed by prepending the name of the calling process and an underscore.

  For example, if a variable named ```voltage``` were collected and the name of this process were ```aREST```, the resulting variable would be named ```aREST_voltage```.
